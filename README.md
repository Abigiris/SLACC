Similarity in Source Code


### Motivation:
1. How is source code similar to itself.
2. Problem with syntactic similarity.
3. Need for language agnostic behaviour. Code Translation. example of ABB


### Research Questions:
0. Coverage:
    In  the  2012  study  of  input  generation across five projects for clone detection conducted by Deissenboecket al. found that  input  generation  and  execution  failed  for  approximately 28% of the methods. Can we do better than this?
1. Clone Detection Rate:  
    How are clones detected compared to HitoshiIO and SourcererCC
2. Quality of Clones:  
    Manually verify how good these clones are compared to SOTA
3. Quality of clones b/w Java and .NET
    Manually verify how good these clones are between two languages.
4. Performance
    Time taken to execute and run this entire process
