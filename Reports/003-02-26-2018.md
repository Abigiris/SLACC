# Week of 02-26-2018

### Done:
  * Handled programatic execution of static C functions. 
    * Converted methods to non static and then executed. 
  * Handled Seg faults. 
    * Used parallel execution using threads.
  * Execute functions using a range of arguments for primitive datatypes
    * **int** = `[-2147483648, -100, -1, 0, 1, 100, 2147483647]`
    * **float** = `[-3.4E+38, -100.0, -1.0, -0.1, 0.0, 0.1, 1.0, 100.0, 3.4E+38]`
    * **char** = `["'a'", "'z'", "'~'", "'#'", "'\t'", "'\n'"]`
  * Saved the function argument, returns and runtimes as a .pickle file which can be now used for comparing functions
  * Study more limitations which can be used to extend range of functions.
    * Consider unsigned values.
    * Consider short, long and long long
     
### Failed to do:
  * None I can think of or jotted down
   
### Next Week:
  * Complete prototype with varying arguments for functions.
