# Week of 03-19-2018

## Legend:
  * Clone : Two functions A and B are clones, if 
    * signature(A) == signature(B) and 
    * outputs(A) == outputs(B) when A,B are given the same inputs.
  * Cluster: List of clones

## Data
  * \#Functions = 40664
    * \#`ReturnType`<sub>int</sub> = 35905
    * \#`ReturnType`<sub>float</sub> = 3877
    * \#`ReturnType`<sub>char</sub> = 664

## Questions
1. What percentage of current corpus have clones?
  * \#`ReturnType`<sub>int</sub> : 26524/35905 = 73.87%
  * \#`ReturnType`<sub>float</sub> : 2850/3877 = 73.51%
  * \#`ReturnType`<sub>char</sub> : 558/644 = 86.65%

2. What are the different kinds of clones in the corpus?
    1. Exact function definition matches. [Check this](https://github.com/dr-bigfatnoob/CodeSeer/blob/master/results/clones/clone_char_000.txt).
      * I am not sure if this kind of clones functions interest us since they are essentially duplicates in the corpus. 
    This implies developers are reusing some functions.
      * I will run a study on these clusters to get back to you with exact numbers on this from the results.
    I presume the percentage in the Q1 would come down if these functions are removed.
    2. Same function bodies but different names. [Check this](https://github.com/dr-bigfatnoob/CodeSeer/blob/master/results/clones/clone_int_006.txt).
    3. Different function bodies. [Check this](https://github.com/dr-bigfatnoob/CodeSeer/blob/master/results/clones/clone_float_001.txt).
   
3. How many clusters and functions exist with just one value in its output distribution?
  * 
    * \#`ReturnType`<sub>int</sub> : 8862 functions in 56 clusters
    * \#`ReturnType`<sub>float</sub> : 824 functions in 15 clusters
    * \#`ReturnType`<sub>char</sub> : 257 functions in 9 clusters
  * I am not sure if these functions interest us. On careful inspection of the functions we can see three cases
    * Either I am not covering all the branches.  
    **Solution**: Use a code coverage tool to generate arguments.
    * Some parameters in the function might be global values which we do not change.  
    **Solution**: Vary global variables as well while generating function arguments.
    * These might be functions which simply `return 0` at the end of function.

4. Should we consider size of function bodies while identifying clones?
  * If we are considering semantic clones for applications like selecting candidates for mutations
   then single line functions might not be good choices right?
   
### Doing
  * Ongoing for the rest of the data(Expecting close to 300000 functions)
  * Repeat this whole thing for java functions
