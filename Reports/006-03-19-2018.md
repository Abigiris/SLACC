### Done
  * Identify clone of function with respect to the output distribution.  
    **Method**
     * Sort the output distributions of two functions.
     * If sorted distributions of the functions are equal the two functions are clones
  * Extended this from 900 functions to 41,000.(Script to extend this by 9 times running)
  
### Results
  * Return Type = `int`(This is only for a small set)
    * \# methods = 885
    * \# methods with no clones = 177
    * \# methods with clones = 885 - 177 = 708
    * \# clusters and \# methods with `x` unique values in output distribution
      * `x=1`: 14, 235
      * `x=2`: 30, 300
      * `x=3`: 1, 2
      * `x=4`: 1, 3
      * `x=5`: 2, 5
      * `x=6`: 1, 2
      * `x=7+`: 36, 161
  * Return Type = `char`
    * \# methods = 664
    * \# methods with no clones = 296
    * \# methods with clones = 664 - 296 = 368
    * \# clusters and \# methods with `x` unique values in output distribution
      * `x=1`: 5, 41
      * `x=2`: 4, 39
      * `x=6`: 3, 14
      * `x=7+`: 16, 254
  * Return Type = `float`
    * \# methods = 3877
    * \# methods with no clones = 1786
    * \# methods with clones = 3877 - 1786 = 1091
    * \# clusters and \# methods with `x` unique values in output distribution
      * `x=1`: 10, 77
      * `x=2`: 5, 75
      * `x=5`: 1, 14
      * `x=6`: 3, 23
      * `x=7+`: 85, 1902
  
### Observations:
  * Clones exist in corpus with respect to outputs.
  * Three types of clones observed on 
    1. Exact function definition matches. [Check this](https://github.com/dr-bigfatnoob/CodeSeer/blob/master/results/clones/clone_char_000.txt).
    2. Same function bodies but different names. [Check this](https://github.com/dr-bigfatnoob/CodeSeer/blob/master/results/clones/clone_int_006.txt).
    3. Different function bodies. [Check this](https://github.com/dr-bigfatnoob/CodeSeer/blob/master/results/clones/clone_float_001.txt).
* From scanning through the documents, the first and third cases are more common
  
   
### Doing
  * Repeat this whole thing for java methods
