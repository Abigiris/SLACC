### Done
  * Identify clone of function with respect to the output distribution.  
    **Method**
     * Sort the output distributions of two functions.
     * If sorted distributions of the functions are equal the two functions are clones
  
## Results
  * Return Type = `int`
    * \# methods = 885
    * \# methods with no clones = 177
    * \# methods with clones = 885 - 177 = 708
    * \# clusters and \# methods with `x` unique elements
      * `x=1`: 14, 235
      * `x=2`: 30, 300
      * `x=3`: 1, 2
      * `x=4`: 1, 3
      * `x=5`: 2, 5
      * `x=6`: 1, 2
      * `x=7+`: 36, 161
  * Return Type = `char`
    * \# methods = 3
    * \# methods with no clones = 0
    * \# methods with clones = 3 - 0 = 3
    * \# clusters and \# methods with `x` unique elements
      * `x=7+`: 1, 3
  * Return Type = `float`
    * \# methods = 12
    * \# methods with no clones = 2
    * \# methods with clones = 12 - 2 = 10
    * \# clusters and \# methods with `x` unique elements
      * `x=1`: 3, 10
  
### Observations and Questions:
  * Clones exist in corpus with respect to outputs.
  * On checking function bodies and output distribution it looks like some branches are not covered. 
  Some of these branches are controlled by global parameters. 
  Should we incorporate coverage techniques to traverse these branches? 
  
   
### Doing
  * Checking out other similarity measures mentioned in literature.
