## Tried increasing coverage by accessing nested code as well.
### Projects analyzed
 
| Project  | SLOC | Prior code coverage \% | Current code coverage \%| 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| [java-design-patterns](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns)  | 27315 | 165 / 0.3185\% | 301 / 0.6041\% |
| [Java-Interview](https://github.com/crossoverJie/Java-Interview) | 1999 | 89 / 3.3517\% | 120 / 4.4522\% |
| [mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) | 43713 | 154 / 0.4644\% | 248 / 0.7961\% |
| [pretty](https://github.com/kubernet/pretty) | 3616 | 31 / 0.8573\% | 31 / 0.8573\% |
| [collections](https://github.com/dr-bigfatnoob/collections) | 3227 | 36 / 1.1156\% | 50 / 1.5494\% |


* Example of [coverage](http://goo.gl/yxuqX6).
* Shifted codebase to NCSU cloud which can now be used to run in parallel.

## Pointers on direction to go next
* Hard to increase coverage anymore since we are using only primitives.
* Should we extend to top java projects in github?
