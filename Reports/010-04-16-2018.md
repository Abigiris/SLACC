# Week of 04-16-2018

### Done
* Extracted lines from functions and grouped them as snippets ranging from 2 lines to length of function.
* Built framework to run test suites of programs. This can be used to extract snippets from functions and perform DFA at each of these snippets.
* Started work on performing Live Variable Analysis at each of these snippets. Last week we were able to show this analysis on intermediate code. 
Started extending this to real code by placing tags across code.


### Next Week
* Identify similar snippets
* Verify if on replacing similar snippets yields same results.
