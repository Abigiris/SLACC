# Week of 04-30-2018

### Done
* Generate input output and execute these inputs.
  * 256 inputs generated
  * Inputs are generated using a piecewise uniform distribution. For example,
    * [-10,10] => 0.1
    * [-100,100] => 0.6
    * [-1000, 1000] => 0.2
    * [MIN_INT, MAX_INT] => 0.1
* Execute these methods on this inputs.
* Cluster the methods using the function definition and the distribution of outputs using DBSCAN. 

### Intermediate results
* Clusters => [Here](files/classcb7ce38404464479ad02259f69f2c16a.txt)

### Next week
* Modify functions to introduce bugs.
* Marking buggy region as a symbolic variable 
* Identify similar snippets as that of the symbolic variable.
