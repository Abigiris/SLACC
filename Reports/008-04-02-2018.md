# Week of 04-02-2018

## Summary
This week there are no results to show. The week was spent brainstorming ideas with Dr Stolee. Post discussion, here is what we came up with
* Using data flow analysis to represent blocks of code as graphs.
* These graphs can be compared using a graph matching problem to identify similar snippets
* While fixing patches, code blocks can be recommended using the semantic similarity of the data flow graph and the syntactic similarity of the code snippet


## Done(Based on the summary)
* Identify snippets from Java code where snippets are control blocks, loops, functions etc. Will need to extend this later groups of line(s).
* Examined IntroClassJava and how it can be used to benchmark.
* Studied tools to instrument code based on data flow analysis. eg. *Low level tools like [asm](http://asm.ow2.org/)* and *high level tools like [soot](https://github.com/Sable/soot)*
