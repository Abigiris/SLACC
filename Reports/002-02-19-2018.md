# Week of 02-19-2018

### Done:
  * Tried to increase search space to handle pointers and arguments.
    * Successful for array arguments for primitive types. This resulted in an increase from 782 to 941 
    fuzzable functions
    * Failed for pointers since they refer to actual addresses.
  * Implemented a rudimentary method where primitive arguments are varied in a range
    * **int** = `[-100, -1, 0, 1, 100]`
    * **float** = `[-100.0, -1.0, -0.1, 0.0, 0.1, 1.0, 100.0]`
    * **char** = `["'a'", "'z'", "'~'", "'#'", "'\t'", "'\n'"]`

### Failed to Complete:
  * Complete prototype using uniform distribution to compare input and outputs of functions
    * **Handling static functions**: Most extracted functions are static hence looking to access them via their pointer 
    locations once compiled.
    * **Handling Seg faults**: This has been resolved now. Running each compilation and function execution as a separate 
    thread to avoid seg faults. Makes the program slower though. Parallely looking into alternatives.
    
### Next Week:
  * Complete prototype with varying arguments for functions.
