# Week of 04-23-2018

### Done
* Group statements as groups of two or more.
* Identify variables within statements which should be used as input 
arguments and those that should be used as return types.
* Build functions using statements, arguments and return types.
* Check validity of functions using an in-memory compiler.
* Framework for executing these functions.

### Intermediate results
* Input java file => [Here](files/Basic.java)
* Generated functions => [Here](files/classea058784973f45deb2155102f7d7a54a.java)

### Next week
* Generate inputs to run these functions on. Will revisit prior work on using uniform values.
* Cluster snippets based on outputs of executed functions.
