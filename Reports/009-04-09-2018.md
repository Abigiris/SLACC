### Done
Please refer [this pdf](files/CFGs.pdf) for analysis of four functions.

#### Functions
1. Sum of numbers from 1 to n using a "for" loop.
2. Sum of numbers from 1 to n using a "while" loop
3. Sum of numbers from 1 to n using mathematical formula n*(n+1)/2
4. A random function called "something_different" containing a while loop.

#### Analysis
Each of the four functions contains

1. Java Code
2. Intermediate code used to generate Control Flow Graph(CFG).
3. Control Flow Graph
4. Live Variable Analysis at each node of CFG.  
  ***Note***: 'E' and 'X' in the CFG represents the live variables at entry and exit respectively.
  
### Observations
1. There is large overlap(almost same except for 3 nodes) between the graphs of the function 1 and function 2(for and while).
2. But the graphs between the function 3(math formula) is not same as that of functions 1 and 2 although it leads the same result. 
3. All other the three functions have extremely different graphs compared to the random function('something_different').
4. Live variable analysis is giving all the active variables at nodes but not how the variables are used. We might need to look into how the variables are used to get a true measure of similarity. i.e Instruction Flow(possibly next on agenda?)
