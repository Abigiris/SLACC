### RQ 0: Coverage measurements
In the 2012 study of input generation across five projects for clone detection conducted by Deissenboecket al. found that input generation and execution failed for approximately 28% of the methods. Can we do better than this?

This shows % of source code covered.

### RQ1: Clone Detection Rate:
How are clones detected compared to HitoshiIO and SourcererCC
### RQ2: Quality of Clones:
Manually verify how good these clones are compared to SOTA
### RQ3: Quality of clones b/w Java and .NET Manually verify how good these clones are between two languages.
### RQ4: Performance Time taken to execute and run this entire process
